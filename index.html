    <p>This is my favorite picture of a lovely cat. The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of 
        small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is 
        often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. 
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids 
        human contact.Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt 
        rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

    <p>My favorite offline game: Plants vs Zombies. Plants vs. Zombies is a video game franchise 
        developed by PopCap Games, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts (EA). The first game, Plants vs. 
        Zombies, was developed and released by PopCap before its acquisition by EA. After PopCap 
        Games's acquisition, EA helped expand the game into a franchise on many platforms and few 
        different genres.</p>
